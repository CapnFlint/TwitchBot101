# Main Program Loop

## Purpose
In the previous section, we were able to connect to IRC and send a basic message.
In order to function as a bot however, we need keep the connection open, and listen
for any and all messages sent to chat.

To do this, we will create the main program loop, which will run forever (or until
  we close down the bot), processing all chat messages seen.
